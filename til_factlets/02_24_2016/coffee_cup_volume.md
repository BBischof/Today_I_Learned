#  Today I learned about: coffee cup volume 
 
The notion of 'a cup' is somewhat interesting. In coffee, a `cup` is a unit of measure that is considered to be `6oz`; cf. a traditional `cup` which is `8oz`. Thus `1 coffee cup = 6oz = .75 cup = 177.5 grams of water`. 
 
...and now, you've learned that too!
