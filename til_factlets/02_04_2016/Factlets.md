# Today I learned about: Factlets

I knew the term "factoid", but not that it implied dubious honesty. I didn't know the word "factlet" until this project, where I learned that factlet is factoid sans scrutiny, and more closely resembles what I thought factoid meant. Also, factlet is cuter. 

...and now, you've learned that too!
