#  Today I learned about: dink 
 
I've been using the word `dink` for a while to mean `fiddle fart` or `linger` or `toil` or other similar things. Today I looked up `dink` and found some interesting things\! First I found out that it can be a shallow sinking shot in tennis, which makes sense. It can also mean `d`ouble `i`ncome `n`o `k`ids, which really surprised me. It can be a little boat, like a dinghy, which I kinda knew. And finally, it's apparently a derogatory term for a Vietnamese person, similar to jerk or nitwit. 
 
...and now, you've learned that too!
