#  Today I learned about: couch types 
 
I was wondering about divans, and exactly how to define them. I found some more good info:  is a small sofa with little arms and a back, surprisingly they  can even look a bit like a pew, if the seat is separate from the back, it can be a bench, and if unupholstered, definitely a bench; a  or better  I knew, just a long chair with a back, and sometimes a single arm, the single arm variety is called a fainting chair(this is cool); a  has no back, but two sides, it kinda looks like two chaises glued together facing one another, and apparently some even have one arm on either side so that two can sit and face one another; finally the , persian origin, fluffy seat, often pushed to wall so pillows can rest up against the wall, similar to a daybed. 
 
...and now, you've learned that too!
