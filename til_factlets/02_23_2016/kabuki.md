#  Today I learned about: kabuki 
 
I didn't know that Kabuki was performed primarily by children. I listened to an NPR story today about a small town in a Japanese mountain town that is concerned that their 300+ yr old Kabuki tradition is going to die because there are so few families moving to the town. 
 
...and now, you've learned that too!
