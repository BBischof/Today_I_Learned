#  Today I learned about: precision vs. recall 
 
I was reading a bit about ML metrics and I found the precise definitions of precision and recall. Given a classifier, the precision is the number of correctly classified values divided by the number of classified values; the recall is the number of correctly classified values divided by the number of of total values in the class. 
 
...and now, you've learned that too!
