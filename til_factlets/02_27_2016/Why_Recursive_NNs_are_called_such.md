#  Today I learned about: Why Recursive NNs are called such 
 
I've been meaning to read about RNNs for a while, and today I finally did; much to my dismay. This nomenclature is stupid in the extreme. It is not recursive, it is iterated. The secondary name for them `tree-structured` is significantly better. Whence my shed full of tools in need of sharpening gains another axe. 
 
...and now, you've learned that too!
