#  Today I learned about: Plackets 
 
Lee had mentioned that he recognized my shirt by the strip of fabric that held the buttons on, and we realized that the name of such a piece of fabric was unknown to either of us. So I went in search of the name. Turns out, it's called a 'Placket', and it is a bit of a general term that can refer to any of the pieces that form attachment joints in clothing. 
 
...and now, you've learned that too!
