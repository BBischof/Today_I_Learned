#  Today I learned about: winding number in graphics 
 
The way of calculating whether or not a region is shaded-- in a vector art illustration with overlapping regions defined by a path--is based on winding number of the path that encloses it. Winding number is a very interesting concept that is relevant in complex analysis and topology, so I'm amsued to see it here. 
 
...and now, you've learned that too!
