#  Today I learned about: kora 
 
I had seen instruments similar to a Kora, but I didn't know this word. I think of them as a derivative of Sitar, but they're not. I also thought of them similar to a lute, which they are very similar to. To be specific, the Kora is a West African cross between a lute and a harp. They are played with only two fingers(thumb and index) and have 21 strings. 
 
...and now, you've learned that too!
