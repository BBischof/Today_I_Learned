#  Today I learned about: wget is left-handed 
 
A while back I explored the idea of left & right hand words(those type-able on a qwerty keyboard with only one hand. Today, I was reading an interesting assessment of Wget vs. Curl, and one of the observations was 'Wget can be typed in using only the left hand on a qwerty keyboard\!'. I was amused. 
 
...and now, you've learned that too!
