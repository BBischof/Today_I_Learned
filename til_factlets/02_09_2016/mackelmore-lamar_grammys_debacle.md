#  Today I learned about: mackelmore-lamar grammys debacle 
 
I hadn't heard about the interaction between Mackelmore and Lamar after the Grammys. From a brief read today, I think the text was in good taste, and it seems from Lamar's reply, that he agrees. Nothing about the text read as inflammatory from my perspective. 
 
...and now, you've learned that too!
