#  Today I learned about: more about bash quotes 
 
I am beginning to think that there is a neverending supply of idiosyncracies about bash and single vs. double quotes. Today I was trying to fig the punctuation issue and discovered that single quotes fix it, but to then allow for contractions, I'm going to have to do a lot more work!(So meta, both of the issues are in this exact til!) 
 
...and now, you've learned that too!
